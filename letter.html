		<h2>Subjects of study
		</h2>
		<p>At the ASF, we have a pretty open-minded research. Saying that, of the 
		ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, 
		in order of priority:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O in wine (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) </li>
			<li>Measuring at temprature 30<sup>o</sup>C(86<sup>o</sup>F), when the audience size 
		exponentialy increase (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> &gt; 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>) </li>
			<li><u>HTML</u> and <u>CSS</u> scores.</li>
		</ol>
				
		<p>So please can you provide more info on each of these subjects? Thansk. </p>
		<h2>Exotic Dance moves</h2>
		<p>Yes, you're right! As part of my post-doctorate, i did study exotic 
		tribal dances. Definitions:</p>
		<dl>
		<dt>Polynesian chicken dances
		<dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300<u>BC</u>, a whoe village 
		would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage or be &quot;fruitful&quot;</dd>
		</dt>
		<dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle
		<dd>Before the Icelander developed fire as means of getting warm, they used to pracetice 
		this dance, which involved hudding close together in a circle on the floor.</dd>
		</dt>
		<dt>Artic robot dance
		<dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers int the 1960s 
		beleived to have  discovered a new dance style by "robotic", stilted movements, being
		 practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada.</dd>
		</dt>
		</dl>
		<p>For more of my research, see my <a href="#">exotic dance research page</a>.</p>
		<p>Yours sincarely.</p>
